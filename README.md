# Battletimer
A lightweight chess clock made with tkinter.

### What is it?
Battletimer is a very lightweight chess clock with multiple features in order to help you have efficient and fun chess games without needing a physical clock! 
It includes many features, including:
* Ability to pause the time
* Changing time to whatever time you want (in format (MM:SS))
* Ability to add increment (seconds) of your choice
* Satisfying sounds


### How to install?
In order to install, all you will need to do is simply run this command in the terminal you want to install Battletimer in:
```
git clone https://github.com/Pinkk-Flag/Battletimer.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd Battletimer
```
However, you will need to install a few modules in order to use it.
To do so, run this command (Windows):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
MacOS/Linux (not entirely sure if it is the case, try windows case first even if on these OS'):
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Afterwards, simply run `main.py` in the root directory and Battletimer should appear!

(Optional) You may also want to convert this into an executable with different things such as cx_freeze for example, it is your choice.

### Why was it made?
Mainly for the fun of it, but it can also help other people who may not have access to a physical clock (because they cost bucket loads of money), while they may have access to a chess board, so it can help make the game go in a timely manner.
